        <p>Hi, I'm <b>Parth</b>, though I go by <b><span>SH4D3</span></b> in the digital realm. At 18 years old, I'm a passionate explorer of the vast realms of <b><i>pure mathematics, its application in finance, statistics, computer science, and <span>cybersecurity (from reverse engineering and binary exploitation to malware analysis and web app penetration testing)</span>. I'm also deeply immersed in chemistry and astrophysics, as they fuel my curiosity for the universe.</i></b> In between, you‚Äôll often find me swimming through buffer overflows‚Äîbecause, why not make debugging an adventure?</p>

        <h2><div>> find / -type f -name "Skillset.txt" </div>Skills I possess as of now.</h2>

            <li>I have some experience with React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Styled Components and React Native.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>As of now, my skill set might resemble that of a <span>'Jack of all trades, master of none.'</span> But don't be fooled‚ÄîI‚Äôm actively working on turning that around! By the end of the year, I plan on making some serious upgrades to this 'diary' of mine. Stay tuned for the transformation!</h4>
